# Hi, I'm Francois ðŸ‘‹

I'm a digital nomad with almost 30 years of software development and product management experience.

I founded my first business in 1996 which I sold in 2005 and since co-founded [myBestHelper](https://github.com/mybesthelper) and [meowbox](https://github.com/meowbox) as well as helped get [CareTeam](https://github.com/careteam-technologies) going. I also worked as an Engineering Lead at [Hootsuite](https://github.com/hootsuite), CTO at both [TINT](https://github.com/hypemarks) and [Zinrelo](https://github.com/zinrelo-org), and currently as CTO at [Affinia Loyalty](https://github.com/affinia-loyalty).

I mentor and advise startups, help on StackOverflow and sometimes speak publicly about business, marketing and technology.
